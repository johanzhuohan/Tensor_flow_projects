Computer vision projects on coursera course "Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning"

Project 1: Handwritten digit recognition with neural network
           * Handwritten digits from MNIST datase
           * 60,000 training set and 10,000 test sets
           * Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes
           * Single hidden layer + output layer

Project 2: Handwritten digit recognition with convolutional neural network
           * Same data set as project 1, but with additional convolution + maxpooling layers.
           * Effect of batch size on training time and accuracy evaluated.
           * Visualization of feature maps on convolution and pooling layers.

Project 3: Happy-or-sad face binary classification with CNN and automatic feature labelling
           * Building a convolutional neural network for binary classification of images.
           * Labelling the data set automatically using ImageDataGenerator in Keras.
           * 80 training set (40 for happy, 40 for sad)
           * Visualization of feature maps on convolution and pooling layers.
