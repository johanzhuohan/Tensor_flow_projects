Natural language processing projects on coursera course "Tensoflow in practice"

Project 1: Movie review binary classification (IMDB.ipynb)
           * Positive and negative movie reviews from IMDB dataset (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
           * 25,000 training set and 25,000 test sets
           * Word embedding for mapping words with semantics in a higher dimensional space
           * Flattening vs Global average pooling


Project 2: Sequential NLP model with IMDB dataset (IMDB_sequential.ipynb)
          * Positive and negative movie reviews from IMDB dataset (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
          * 25,000 training set and 25,000 test sets
          * Different types of sequential and convolutional models tested: LSTM, GRU, and 1D convolution.

Project 3: Poetry generator with Shakespeare sonnets (Shakespeare_generator)
          * Machine learned poetry generator using Shakespeare sonnets.
          * Current sentences as inputs, and next word as labels.
          * Word embedding and (bidirectional) LSTM.
          * Dropout and L2 regularization for avoiding overfitting.
