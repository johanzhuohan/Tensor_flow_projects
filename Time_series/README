Time series projects on coursera course "Tensorflow in practice"

Project 1: Statistical forecasring on synthesized time siries (Stat_forecast.ipynb)
          * Forecasting on synthesized time series with statistical method: naive forecasting and moving average.
          * Differencing on data is used for better moving average.
          * Trailing vs centered moving average.

Project 2: Deep neural network model on synthesized time series (DNN_forecast.ipynb)
          * Use linear regression and deep neural network to forecast a synthesized time siries
          * Windowed time siries for training.
          * Dynamic tuning of learning rate with callbacks.

Project 3: Revursive neural network model on synthesized time series (RNN_forecast.ipynb)
          * Use sequence RNN models for forecasting synthesized time sires.
          * Comparison of simple RNN vs LSTM
          * Windowed time siries for training.
          * Dynamic tuning of learning rate with callbacks.
          * Lambda layers for pre- and post-processing of data within NN.
