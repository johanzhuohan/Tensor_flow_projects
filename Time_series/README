Time series projects on coursera course "Tensorflow in practice"

Project 1: Statistical forecasring on synthesized time siries (Stat_forecast.ipynb)
          * Forecasting on synthesized time series with statistical method: naive forecasting and moving average.
          * Differencing on data is used for better moving average.
          * Trailing vs centered moving average.

Project 2: Deep neural network model on synthesized time series (DNN_forecast.ipynb)
          * Use linear regression and deep neural network to forecast a synthesized time siries
          * Windowed time series for training.
          * Dynamic tuning of learning rate with callbacks.

Project 3: Revursive neural network model on synthesized time series (RNN_forecast.ipynb)
          * Use sequence RNN models for forecasting synthesized time sires.
          * Comparison of simple RNN vs LSTM
          * Windowed time series for training.
          * Dynamic tuning of learning rate with callbacks.
          * Lambda layers for pre- and post-processing of data within NN.

Project 4: LSTM + CNN for sunspot time sires (LSTM_Conv_forecase.ipynb)
         * Experiment with the effect of an addtional Convolutional layer on LSTM model performance on forecasting real life time sires.
         * Real life time siries of sunspot intensity
         * Windowed time series for training.
         * Dynamic tuning of learning rate with callbacks.
         * Lambda layers for post-processing of data within NN.
         * Experiments with tuning hyperparameters.
