Time series projects on coursera course "Tensorflow in practice"

Project 1: Statistical forecasring on synthesized time siries (Stat_forecast.ipynb)
          * Forecasting on synthesized time series with statistical method: naive forecasting and moving average.
          * Differencing on data is used for better moving average.
          * Trailing vs centered moving average.

Project 2: Deep neural network model on synthesized time series (DNN.ipynb)
          * Use linear regression and deep neural network to forecast a synthesized time siries
          * Windowed time siries for training.
          * Automatic tuning of learning rate with callbacks.
